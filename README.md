This is a simple module to make it easy to use [Mustache]() templates in frameworks such as [ExpreeJS](http://expressjs.com).
The entire module is pretty much a copy of what [Ryan Probasco](http://twitter.com/#!/bitdrift) wrote in a [blog entry](http://bitdrift.com/post/2376383378/using-mustache-templates-in-express) about enabling Mustache templates in Express.

I just made this module to make it simple to plug Mustache into Express apps.
